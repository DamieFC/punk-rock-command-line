# Punk Rock Command Line
## About
The Punk Rock Command Line is a command line for fun use only, not for work, it just has a lot of commands related to punk bands.
## Idea
The idea came while working on another repository, the Platypus Command Line thing. I was listening to punk rock music on Pandora, and the idea just came.
## DON'T SUE ME!!!!
This has a lot of references to punk bands, and I didn't get permission (Alternative Tentacles' website says right on it they may not get back to you), so PLEASE, DON'T SUE ME!!!!!!
## Contributing
If you want to contribute, make a fork, branch, whatever, add files, don't really care. If you can help, please do. THANKS!
