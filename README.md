# Punk Rock Command Line
## About
The Punk Rock Command Line is a command line for fun use only, not for work, it just has a lot of commands related to punk bands.
## Idea
The idea came while working on another repository, the Platypus Command Line thing. I was listening to punk rock music on Pandora, and the idea just came.
## Disclaimer
This has a lot of references to punk bands, and I didn't get permission (Alternative Tentacles' website says right on it they may not get back to you), so sorry of this violates any music copyrights, I'll take it down if you ask, sorry!
## Contributing
If you want to contribute, make a fork, branch, whatever, add files, don't really care. If you can help, please do. THANKS!
